My contribution to the paper was writing a graph visualisation tool to view the spread of a 1600s plague over the course of a few months, with a UI to tweak parameters. The program also solved for a 'best fit' graph of the plague, using the plague data recorded by Mompesson during the Eyam plague, with an iterative method to improve the approximations.
